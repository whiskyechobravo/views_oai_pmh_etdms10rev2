Views OAI-PMH ETD-MS 1.00 revision 2
====================================

This is an extension to the
[Views OAI-PMH](https://github.com/whiskyechobravo/views_oai_pmh) (fork) module
for Drupal 7. It provides support for the Interoperability Metadata Standard
for Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETD-MS) 1.00 revision 2 metadata
format.

While the Views OAI-PMH module provides support for ETD-MS 1.1, this extension
supports the older ETD-MS 1.00 revision 2 format. Some harvesters, such as
Library and Archives Canada (LAC)'s ETD Harvesting Program, do not support the
latest ETD-MS format, so this extension might come in handy.


Requirements
------------

Required packages:

* [Drupal 7.x](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal)
* [Views 7.x-3.x](https://www.drupal.org/project/views)
* [Views OAI-PMH](https://github.com/whiskyechobravo/views_oai_pmh) (fork)

This extension will NOT work with the
[original Views OAI-PMH](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_oai_pmh) module.
The fork is required (see the above link).


Installing the module
---------------------

To install and enable this module, please follow the usual [instructions for
module installation](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7).

If you have existing OAI-PMH views, the new metadata format should become
available in the views' OAI-PMH mapping options. The format is disabled by
default.
